In the example of ticketset for pvd.

Consecution:
+ Not sure how to proceed with VC 26

+ Transition 89 is not verified because is a transition taken by thread "t".  
however, such transition should not exist as node 2 (where the transition 
begins) is not included into a bow labeled with "t". However, paying attention 
to the code for consecution, the transition is generated according to condition 
C1 on page of the paper. Hence... Â¿Is that rule of the paper wrong?

+ Not sure how to interpret VC 90. How may I say that t != k as precondition?
