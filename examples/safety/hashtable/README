This folder contains the example of concurrent hash tables.



In this folder you will find some scripts to run the examples:

run.sh:
	executes the example for verifying that the transition which connects a 
	new node to the table preserves the hash table property.


IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.



The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.



For further information regarding how to configure Leap or edit the files 
within this example, please refer to:
