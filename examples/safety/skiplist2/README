This folder contains the example of sequential skiplists with at most 2 
levels.



In this folder you will find a "run.sh" script to run the example. Inside 
the script you can configure the options you want Leap to use.

IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.



The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.



For further information regarding how to configure Leap or edit the files 
within this example, please refer to:
