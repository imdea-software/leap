This folder contains the example of concurrent lock-free lists.



In this folder you will find some scripts to run the examples:

run.sh:
  executes the example for list shape preservation.


Inside each script you can configure the options you want Leap to use.

IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.



The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.
