This folder contains the example of sequential skiplists with at most 4 
levels.



In this folder you will find a "run.sh" script to run the example. Inside 
the script you can configure the options you want Leap to use.

IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.

IMPORTANT: Currently LEAP is compatible with Yices 1.x. We are working in making
           LEAP compatible with Yices2. If Yices2 is installed in your system
           instead of Yices 1.x, the examples on this folder will fail to work
           properly.


The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.



For further information regarding how to configure Leap or edit the files 
within this example, please refer to:
