This folder contains the example of a mutual exclusion algorithm based on 
tickets implemented with set of integers.



In this folder you will find a "run_safety.sh" and "run_liveness.sh" 
script. The scripts run the example. Script "run_safety.sh" executes Leap 
in order to prove that the specifications used as support are in fact 
invariants of the system. Script "run_liveness.sh" executes Leap to verify 
the liveness property that, if a thread decides to enter the critical 
section then eventually it is granted the permission to access the 
critical section.

Inside each script you can configure the options you want Leap to use.

Additionally, file "ticketset_modelcheck.smv" contains the NuSMV 
specification that proves that condition ModelCheck for this example 
holds.


IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.



The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + pvd: contains the description of the parametrized verification diagram 
         and a description of the invariants required as support.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.
