This folder contains the example of concurrent lock-coupling single-liked 
lists.



In this folder you will find a "run_safety.sh" and "run_liveness.sh" 
script. The scripts run the example. Script "run_safety.sh" executes Leap 
in order to prove that the specifications used as support are in fact 
invariants of the system. Script "run_liveness.sh" executes Leap to verify 
the liveness property that...

Inside each script you can configure the options you want Leap to use.

IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.



The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + pvd: contains the description of the parametrized verification diagram 
         and a description of the invariants required as support.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.
