This folder contains the example of concurrent lock-coupling single-liked 
lists.



In this folder you will find three scripts named "run_safety.sh", 
"run_safety_extra.sh" and "run_liveness.sh". The scripts run the example.  
Scripts "run_safety.sh" and "run_safety_extra.sh" execute Leap in order to 
prove that the specifications used as support are in fact invariants of 
the system. Script "run_liveness.sh" executes Leap to verify the liveness 
property that whenever an arbitrary thread attempts to insert an element 
in the list, then this thread eventually succeeds.

Inside each script you can configure the options you want Leap to use.

Additionally, file "lists_modelcheck.smv" contains the NuSMV specification 
that proves that condition ModelCheck for this example holds.

IMPORTANT: You must configure the path to Leap inside the script before you
           can run it.



The other folders within this folder are:

  + graphs: contains the proof graph for this example.

  + invs: contains the invariant candidates.

  + prgs: contains the program under verification.

  + pvd: contains the description of the parametrized verification diagram 
         and a description of the invariants required as support.

  + vcs: here are output the generated VCs during the verification process, 
         just to provide extra information.
