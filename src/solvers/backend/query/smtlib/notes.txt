Both files SMTTllQuery_extended.ml and SMTTllQuery_reduced.ml contain an
implementation to translate TLL formulas to SMTLIB formulas. The main difference
resides in the fact that "extended" version performs an unfold of many functions
(such as setunion) considering only the cases appearing in the formula. The
"reduced" version is more generic, but a little bit slower as well.
